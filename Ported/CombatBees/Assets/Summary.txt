- Resources (green discs) spawn in the middle. Yellow bees spawn in the yellow base. Blue bees spawn in the blue base.
- Resources spawned at the same location will stack on top of each other.
- Bees pick up resources and drop them in their base.
- When a resource hits the ground of a base, it explodes, spawning several bees of that base's color.
- Bees not carrying resources may attack and destroy enemy bees.
- A destroyed bee emits bee fragments and blood splatters, and the resource eventually carried falls to the ground.
- Blood splatters on surfaces shrink to nothing over time.
- Each bee's displayed scale oscillates along all three axes, but this is just a visual effect. Collisions are not affected.
- Keyboard controls allow the user to reset the simulation.
- Left mouse clicks spawn additional resources at the point clicked (determined by casting a ray from the cursor).
- The camera can be controlled with the mouse (hold down right button to rotate, use mouse wheel to zoom).


TODO:
- camera controls (rotate + zoom)
- Bee bases with bee spawning
- Bee AI (go pick resources, avoid other bees, attack enemy bees, drop resources)
- Bee VFX (scaling, death)
- Reset simulation
